# kdiff-coincident

This repository contains the code and data needed for this project. The dataset was created using a computing cluster, and is thus the code is written in a parallel format. I have also provided the results of the simulation in `analysis/results.txt`, so that others can take a look at the results without having to re-run the simulation.
